##### [INTRO MUSIC]

#### EIFFEL

This is the audio log of Communications Officer Doug Eiffel, speaking from the comms room of the USS Hephaestus Station. Welcome to day four hundred and forty-eight of our orbit around [belch] red dwarf star Wolf 359! Today’s weather report: pretty nominal, surface temperatures averaging at about… oh, a crisp forty-five hundred degrees Fahrenheit! Instruments are picking up less than… ten percent chance of stellar flares. Just another happy, sunny day out here, seven and a half light years away from Earth.

##### [SOUND OF CREAKING METAL]

Minkowski and I finally cleared up that problem with the temperature on the station. All the climate control systems are back to normal, and our stalwart autopilot Hera promises she’ll be a little less gung-ho in her efforts to conserve power. Y'know, I understand that as an artificial intelligence, it’s difficult for her to remember that human beings can’t function at four hundred below zero.

##### [SOUND OF CREAKING METAL]

That’s fine, everyone makes mistakes. But if she could stop talking about my “fragile, carbon-based uncomfortably liquid body”, it’d be a real breakthrough for human-AI relations. Speaking of scientific advancement, it’s been three days since Hilbert’s came out of his lab. I think this is the… fourth time since mission launch he’s been sitting with us at dinner, suddenly yelled “Of course!”, and ran off! I can’t understand what Hilbert’s saying half the time anyway. It’s just as well, I’m still banned from the lab. You accidentally knock over one vat of acid and almost burn a hole in the hull, and suddenly you’re – well yeah, I guess that’s fair. Whatever you’re up to, Dr Hilbert, best of luck.

##### [RUSTLING SOUNDS]

I gotta be careful with these. Minkowski confiscated another cigarette carton today. You’d think that after a year and a half on this tin can, our resident Statsi agent would let up. I get it, cigarettes are contraband. But it’s not like if she let me have one I’d immediately light it and accidentally set the station’s air supply on fire. Again. The people on this station have serious stress issues. That makes the tally… seventeen cartons that she’s confiscated, and _[clicking tongue]_ one, two, three still tucked in the back of the auxiliary comms panel. Safe and sound. I gotta stay sharp about where  I leave these things though. I know I can’t actually smoke ‘em, I-I just like being able to… have them in my mouth. I like the taste! _[with cigarette in mouth]_ Aw yeah, eat your heart out, you succulent rat-killing tar!

Alrighty folks, let’s see if we can actually get some work done, shall we? Our mission tonight is the same as last night, and the night before that. And the previous four hundred nights, unto the end of my attention span! Scan the heavens for any signs of intelligent life. Yesterday we spent a very relaxing three hours listening to absolute silence coming from the Theta-Nu quadrant. And that was great. That was just great. Today, how 'bout we take a look at what’s going on around the Alpha-Psi sector! [typing sounds] Is today the day we make first contact? Whaddya say, Alpha-Psi One?

##### [STATIC]

Outstanding!

##### [TYPING SOUNDS]

Alpha-Psi sector bearing one? No contact! Whaddya say, Alpha-Psi Two?

##### [STATIC]

Bearing two, same as it ever was! How’re you feeling, bearing three?

##### [STATIC]

Well folks, I don’t need to tell you that we are in for one exciting evening. I mean, I don’t know if you have any dinner plans, but-

##### [STRANGE BLOOPING AND WHIRRING SOUNDS]

What the hell? D-di-did I just hear- I thought I just heard something for a moment there? Hello. Alpha-Psi sector bearing three. Is anybody out there? Does anybody copy?

##### [STATIC]

No, I suppose not. I must be hearing things, I-I mean, hearing things is my job, but y-you know what I mean.

##### [STATIC]

Y'know what, I-I think I need some coffee. T-that’ll make things better. I’ll be right back.


##### [BREAK WITH BACKGROUND PIANO MUSIC]

#### EIFFEL

Alright, I’m back! And I have coffee! 

##### [DRINKING THROUGH STRAW SOUND]

Of course, it’s not actually coffee, it’s mostly blended seaweed with some proteins and stimulants. Hibert says he got it as close to the taste of coffee grounds as he could, but, that’s not saying much. Calling it coffee helps. 

##### [DRINKING THROUGH STRAW SOUND]

Speaking of the good doctor, I passed by his lab on the way to the kitchen. Some pretty weird noises coming from inside, even for him. Check this out.

##### [LOW-FIDELITY CHUGGING MACHINERY AND WHIRRING SOUND]

So that’s happening. Once again, I hope you know what you’re doing, Dr Hilbert.

##### [OPEN INTERCOM BEEP]

Oh no, it looks like we have an unscheduled caller on line one, dear listeners.

#### MINKOWSKI

Eiffel?

#### EIFFEL

Yeah, Minkowski?

#### MINKOWSKI

Excuse me?

#### EIFFEL

How may I be of service, Commander Minkovski, Sir? Don’t tell me you need more cigarettes already, I gave you a full carton this afternoon.

#### MINKOWSKI

Very funny. Eiffel, did you read your copy of Pryce and Carter?

#### EIFFEL

My copy of what?

#### MINKOWSKI

Pryce and Carter’s Deep Space Survival  Procedure Protocol Manual.

#### EIFFEL

Is that one of those mandatory mission training things?

#### MINKOWSKI

Yes…

#### EIFFEL

In that case yes. I definitely did.
 
#### MINKOWSKI

Did you now? Because I happened to find your copy of the DSSPPM floating in the observation deck.

#### EIFFEL

Oh?

#### MINKOWSKI

Still in its plastic wrapping!

#### EIFFEL

Oh. In that case, I’ve been busy.

#### MINKOWSKI

Get to it, Eiffel. We may be eight light years from Earth, but we still do things by the book. This book, in fact. I want you to have it read by 0600 tomorrow.

#### EIFFEL

Gee Commander, I’d love to do that but I’ve got all this deep space survey to do tonight, very very complicated technical stuff that requires my full attention so-

#### MINKOWSKI

If you can’t recite that entire book, backwards and forwards, by tomorrow, I’ll not only confiscate the cigarettes you’ve got in the comms panel, I’ll make you watch as I flush them out the airlock, one by one.

#### EIFFEL

Well. Clearly this is an important matter that requires my immediate attention.

#### MINKOWSKI

Glad we understand each other.

##### [CLOSE INTERCOM BEEP]

#### EIFFEL

And I’m so glad your shrivelled husk of a dictator’s heart is as warm as a decompression chamber. Augh! [deep breath] Alright. Let’s get this over with.

Hera?

#### HERA

Yes, Officer Eiffel?

#### EIFFEL

Have you got this… Jimmy Carter thing in your databanks?

#### HERA

Pryce and Carter’s Deep Space Survival Procedure Protocol Manual is among the files I have access to.

#### EIFFEL

Can you please reproduce the contents of that file?

#### HERA

Certainly. Would you like me to broadcast this throughout all of the station?

#### EIFFEL

Oh, uh, no no no no no, let’s, uh, let’s have this be a just the two of us, totally secret, never tell Commander Minkowski thing alright?

#### HERA

Very well. Ready to begin?

#### EIFFEL

Ready as I’ll ever be. Take me away, sweetheart.

##### [CHEERFUL BACKGROUND MUSIC]

#### HERA

Pryce and Carter’s Deep Space Survival Procedure Protocol Manual. Congratulations on your assignment to a deep space outpost. Whether your stay is of a scientific, exploratory, or disciplinary nature, we hope you enjoy a peaceful, restive, minimal casualty residency in your spacecraft of choice. To maximise your chances of a successful return to Earth with all your limbs and faculties intact, please display a strict adherence to the following one thousand and one survival tips.

#### EIFFEL

One thousand and- ugh, it’s extra one that’s really annoying.

#### HERA

Deep space survival tip number one: Always read the instructions before operating any piece of machinery. Deviating from this might result in the loss of valuable equipment, which could lead to heavy fines, or death. Deep space survival tip number two: Begin every day with a few minutes of exercise.

#### EIFFEL

_[talking over Hera]_ Oh, seriously?

#### HERA

Isometric exercises are no harder to do in zero gravity than on Earth, and just as rewarding!

#### EIFFEL

Jeez, I’m going to need some more coffee.

#### HERA

Deep space survival tip number three: Space walks are a very serious matter. _[Eiffel yawns]_ They are very delicate operations filled with hazards, so only use them as a source of amusement if you are really bored.

#### EIFFEL

I could really go for one of those just about now.

#### HERA

Deep space survival tip number four: Conserve your oxygen; even in environments with an air recycling system, oxygen can be limited, so keep your breathing at a slow, steady pace. Remain calm. Failing to remain calm could result in your grisly, gruesome death, so whatever you do, do not panic. Panicking will only serve to accelerate your oxygen consumption, and make your already likely demise a certainty. If you want to avoid dying painfully alone in the cold darkness of space gasping desperately as freezing oblivion silences your pathetic hopes and dreams, [deep breath] relax. Deep space survival tip number five: Remain positive at all times. Maintain a cheerful attitude, even in the face of adversity. Remember: when you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you. But when you’re crying, you’re in violation of fleet-wide morale codes and should report to your superior officer for disciplinary action.

##### [STRANGE BLOOPING AND WHIRRING SOUNDS AGAIN, GETTING LOUDER]

Deep space survival tip number six: be mindful of your personal hygiene-
 
#### EIFFEL

My god, there it is again. Hera, shut up! That’s definitely a transmission. I might be able to clean it up a bit, actually, c'mere you, hold on… 

##### [TYPING S0UNDS]
##### [STRANGE BLOOPING AND WHIRRING SOUNDS BECOME STATIC, THEN FAINT PIANO MUSIC, THEN BACK TO STATIC]

No no no no no! Come back! Damn it! Lost the signal again. I’m not crazy! There’s definitely something out there. Come on, talk to me, whoever you are! I say again, Alpha-Psi sector, bearing three, do you copy?

##### [LOUD GROANING METAL SOUND]

What w-what was that? Are we seriously blowing up now? Is there a survival tip on what to do if we’re blowing up?

##### [OPEN INTERCOM BEEP]

#### MINKOWSKI

What the hell was that? Eiffel, were you smoking again?

#### EIFFEL

I was not!

#### MINKOWSKI

If I come down there and find a single burn ma-

##### [OPEN INTERCOM BEEP]

#### HILBERT

_[coughing]_ Eiffel’s not at fault, Commander, loud noise came from my laboratory. Apologies, didn’t mean to cause distraction.

#### MINKOWSKI

Dr Hilbert? Are you okay?

#### HILBERT

Naturally, why is state of my health in question?

#### MINKOWSKI

That was a rather loud explosion.

#### HILBERT

Erroneous assumption, loud noise was not explosion.

#### EIFFEL

Then, what was it?

#### HILBERT

Don’t know, something else. Not explosion, something… less destructive. 

##### [CRACKLING NOISES, GETTING LOUDER]

A hairdryer, perhaps.

#### MINKOWSKI

Dr Hilbert, is anything around you on fire?

#### HILBERT

Definitely not! Well, probably, too busy with experimental sample to look round. Rigorous observation cycle, must devote full attention. Hilbert out.

##### [CLOSE INTERCOM BEEP]

#### MINKOWSKI

Hera?

#### HERA

The current temperature in the laboratory is two hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit. And rising.

#### MINKOWSKI

And I’m guessing that the fire containment system…?

#### HERA

Is still out of order due to last week’s electrical outage.

#### MINKOWSKI

Great. Well, I guess we gotta break into his lab and make sure he doesn’t die.

#### EIFFEL

Hey, I’m still banned from those premises, and last time I checked, he outranks me. This is all you.

#### MINKOWSKI

Eiffel, a man’s life might be at risk.

#### EIFFEL

If only we didn’t do things by the book around here…

#### MINKOWSKI

If you’re not down at the lab in five minutes, I’m going to make sure that your rations for the rest of the mission are nothing-

#### EIFFEL

_[talking over Minkowski]_ Ah, what’s that Commander? Oh, you’re breaking up, the fire must be interfering with the intercom system.

#### MINKOWSKI

Oh don’t you dare! Do not do this Eiffel, I am not playing around I swear to God-

#### EIFFEL

Are you there? Do you copy?

#### MINKOWSKI

Eiffel. Eiffel!

#### EIFFEL

Oh there’s that mute button, yes.

#### MINKOWSKI

Eiffel!

##### [CLOSE INTERCOM BEEP]

#### EIFFEL

Have fun with the rescue op!

#### EIFFEL

_[sigh]_ Alone at last.

#### HERA

Would you like me to resume the reading where we left off?

#### EIFFEL

As… scintillating as that sounds, Hera, I think we can just leave it.

#### HERA

Are you certain?

#### EIFFEL

Yeah, I get the gist of it. Besides, I feel like there’s something I’m-

##### [STRANGE BLOOPING AND WHIRRING SOUNDS START AGAIN]

-forgetting! Right! That! What are you? Who’s out there? _[clears throat]_ Hello. Does anyone copy. This is Douglas Eiffel aboard the USS Hephaestus Station. Please respond. Again, is anybody out there? Please respond.

##### [STRANGE BLOOPING AND WHIRRING BECOMES FAINT PIANO MUSIC, "THE ENTERTAINER" BY SCOTT JOPLIN]

Oh god. Oh, sweet, merciful, tap-dancing zombie chorus girls. It’s an old radio broadcast from Earth! A signal sent out, oh god, this must be decades old! All this time, it’s just been travelling through space, bouncing from star to star… I mean, just imagine, of all the odds, of all the space, it just happens to run into us. You’ve gotta wonder how many things this song has seen. Well it looks like I didn’t stumble onto alien life today. But y'know, as consolations prizes go, a reminder that Earth is out there, waiting. With all it’s hi-fis and smoking sections, and triple white chocolate mochas with whipped cream… that ain’t half bad. Heh, well until we meet again, this is Hephaestus Station Comms Officer Doug Eiffel signing off.

##### [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES TO PLAY]

I should probably go make sure Hilbert isn’t burning to death.

##### [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES TO PLAY BUT AT A SLOWER TEMPO]

Eh, I’ll go after this song is over.

##### [PIANO MUSIC ENDS]

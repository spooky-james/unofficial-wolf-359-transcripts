##### [INTRO MUSIC]

#### EIFFEL

This is the audio log of Communications Officer Doug Eiffel, speaking from the comms room of the USS Hephaestus Station. Welcome to day four hundred and forty-eight of our orbit around [belch] red dwarf star Wolf 359! Today’s weather report: pretty nominal, surface temperatures averaging at about… oh, a crisp forty-five hundred degrees Fahrenheit! Instruments are picking up less than… ten percent chance of stellar flares. Just another happy, sunny day out here, seven and a half light years away from Earth.

##### [SOUND OF CREAKING METAL]

Minkowski and I finally cleared up that problem with the temperature on the station. All the climate control systems are back to normal, and our stalwart autopilot Hera promises she’ll be a little less gung-ho in her efforts to conserve power. Y'know, I understand that as an artificial intelligence, it’s difficult for her to remember that human beings can’t function at four hundred below zero.

##### [SOUND OF CREAKING METAL]

That’s fine, everyone makes mistakes. But if she could stop talking about my “fragile, carbon-based uncomfortably liquid body”, it’d be a real breakthrough for human-AI relations. Speaking of scientific advancement, it’s been three days since Hilbert’s came out of his lab. I think this is the… fourth time since mission launch he’s been sitting with us at dinner, suddenly yelled “Of course!”, and ran off! I can’t understand what Hilbert’s saying half the time anyway. It’s just as well, I’m still banned from the lab. You accidentally knock over one vat of acid and almost burn a hole in the hull, and suddenly you’re – well yeah, I guess that’s fair. Whatever you’re up to, Dr Hilbert, best of luck.

##### [RUSTLING SOUNDS]

I gotta be careful with these. Minkowski confiscated another cigarette carton today. You’d think that after a year and a half on this tin can, our resident Statsi agent would let up. I get it, cigarettes are contraband. But it’s not like if she let me have one I’d immediately light it and accidentally set the station’s air supply on fire. Again. The people on this station have serious stress issues. That makes the tally… seventeen cartons that she’s confiscated, and _[clicking tongue]_ one, two, three still tucked in the back of the auxiliary comms panel. Safe and sound. I gotta stay sharp about where  I leave these things though. I know I can’t actually smoke ‘em, I-I just like being able to… have them in my mouth. I like the taste! _[with cigarette in mouth]_ Aw yeah, eat your heart out, you succulent rat-killing tar!

Alrighty folks, let’s see if we can actually get some work done, shall we? Our mission tonight is the same as last night, and the night before that. And the previous four hundred nights, unto the end of my attention span! Scan the heavens for any signs of intelligent life. Yesterday we spent a very relaxing three hours listening to absolute silence coming from the Theta-Nu quadrant. And that was great. That was just great. Today, how 'bout we take a look at what’s going on around the Alpha-Psi sector! [typing sounds] Is today the day we make first contact? Whaddya say, Alpha-Psi One?

##### [STATIC]

Outstanding!

##### [TYPING SOUNDS]

Alpha-Psi sector bearing one? No contact! Whaddya say, Alpha-Psi Two?

##### [STATIC]

Bearing two, same as it ever was! How’re you feeling, bearing three?

##### [STATIC]

Well folks, I don’t need to tell you that we are in for one exciting evening. I mean, I don’t know if you have any dinner plans, but-

##### [STRANGE BLOOPING AND WHIRRING SOUNDS]

What the hell? D-di-did I just hear- I thought I just heard something for a moment there? Hello. Alpha-Psi sector bearing three. Is anybody out there? Does anybody copy?

##### [STATIC]

No, I suppose not. I must be hearing things, I-I mean, hearing things is my job, but y-you know what I mean.

##### [STATIC]

Y'know what, I-I think I need some coffee. T-that’ll make things better. I’ll be right back.


##### [BREAK WITH BACKGROUND PIANO MUSIC]

#### EIFFEL

Alright, I’m back! And I have coffee! 

##### [DRINKING THROUGH STRAW SOUND]

Of course, it’s not actually coffee, it’s mostly blended seaweed with some proteins and stimulants. Hibert says he got it as close to the taste of coffee grounds as he could, but, that’s not saying much. Calling it coffee helps. 

##### [DRINKING THROUGH STRAW SOUND]

Speaking of the good doctor, I passed by his lab on the way to the kitchen. Some pretty weird noises coming from inside, even for him. Check this out.

##### [LOW-FIDELITY CHUGGING MACHINERY AND WHIRRING SOUND]

So that’s happening. Once again, I hope you know what you’re doing, Dr Hilbert.

##### [OPEN INTERCOM BEEP]

Oh no, it looks like we have an unscheduled caller on line one, dear listeners.

#### MINKOWSKI

Eiffel?

#### EIFFEL

Yeah, Minkowski?

#### MINKOWSKI

Excuse me?

#### EIFFEL

How may I be of service, Commander Minkovski, Sir? Don’t tell me you need more cigarettes already, I gave you a full carton this afternoon.

#### MINKOWSKI

Very funny. Eiffel, did you read your copy of Pryce and Carter?

#### EIFFEL

My copy of what?

#### MINKOWSKI

Pryce and Carter’s Deep Space Survival  Procedure Protocol Manual.

#### EIFFEL

Is that one of those mandatory mission training things?

#### MINKOWSKI

Yes…

#### EIFFEL

In that case yes. I definitely did.
 
#### MINKOWSKI

Did you now? Because I happened to find your copy of the DSSPPM floating in the observation deck.

#### EIFFEL

Oh?

#### MINKOWSKI

Still in its plastic wrapping!

#### EIFFEL

Oh. In that case, I’ve been busy.

#### MINKOWSKI

Get to it, Eiffel. We may be eight light years from Earth, but we still do things by the book. This book, in fact. I want you to have it read by 0600 tomorrow.

#### EIFFEL

Gee Commander, I’d love to do that but I’ve got all this deep space survey to do tonight, very very complicated technical stuff that requires my full attention so-

#### MINKOWSKI

If you can’t recite that entire book, backwards and forwards, by tomorrow, I’ll not only confiscate the cigarettes you’ve got in the comms panel, I’ll make you watch as I flush them out the airlock, one by one.

#### EIFFEL

Well. Clearly this is an important matter that requires my immediate attention.

#### MINKOWSKI

Glad we understand each other.

##### [CLOSE INTERCOM BEEP]

#### EIFFEL

And I’m so glad your shrivelled husk of a dictator’s heart is as warm as a decompression chamber. Augh! [deep breath] Alright. Let’s get this over with.

Hera?

#### HERA

Yes, Officer Eiffel?
